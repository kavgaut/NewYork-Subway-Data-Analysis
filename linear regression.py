    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~15%) of the data contained in 
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with 
    this computer on your own computer, locally. 
    
    
    If you'd like to view a plot of your cost history, uncomment the call to 
    plot_cost_history below. The slowdown from plotting is significant, so if you 
    are timing out, the first thing to do is to comment out the plot command again.
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are 
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a 
    smaller number for num_iterations if that's the case.
    
    If you are using your own algorithm/models, see if you can optimize your code so 
    that it runs faster.
